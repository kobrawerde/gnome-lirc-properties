# Local version of the LIRC Hardware DataBase, providing information that
# is not in the regular version, or is not correct in the regular version.
#
# The regular version of this file is normally found
# at /usr/share/lirc/lirc.hwdb
# and appears to be only in Debian/Ubuntu.
#
# This currently uses key/value though lirc.hwdb uses a comma-separated list:
#
#       [remote controls type]
#       description;driver;lirc driver;HW_DEFAULT;lircd_conf;
#
# Reasons for this discrepancy are:
#
#       * Model and vendor names are not separated in lirc.hwdb.
#         Many entries in lirc.hwdb don't even have vendor information.
#
#       * Comma-separated list are not very future proof.
#         Adding new fields can break existing applications.
#
# So for now we keep our information here, in a human and machine friendly file
# format, which is easy to extend.
#
# TODO: Talk to the lirc maintainers regarding the hardware database,
#       once this file is know to be feature complete.
#       Though this may be a Debian/Ubuntu-only file.
